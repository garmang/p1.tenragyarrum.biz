					<h1>Garnett Murray's Bio</h1>
					<p>Hi, Im Garnett Murray and this is my bio! I live in Hamden CT and attend Harvard Extension. I am a senior studying psychology and Government
					as a Social Sciences concentrator. I took a Java I course and was hooked, so I am now taking Building Dynamic Web Applications
					So I can use my creativity and learn to build websites!</p> 
				
					<h2>What I Like</h2>
					<p>	For recreation I like tennis and running. My favorite pro sports teams are the Denver Broncos, Oklahoma Sooners as well as Harvard Crimson football and basketball.</p>
					
					<h2>What I do</h2>	
					<p>I work as a paraprofessional in an elementary school in Bridgeport, CT, the kids are cool(thank God). I hope to do well and get a full understanding of front end web development
					and some day work as a web developer.
					</p>
			
					<h2>Web Editor of Choice</h2>
					<p>As a new web development student, my first web editor was Eclipse when learning Java, but I like TextWrangler best for its simplicity.
